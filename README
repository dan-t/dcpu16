Yet another parser, assembler and emulator for the dcpu16. (http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt)

Make and Install:
   cabal install dcpu16.cabal

Assembler:
   asm16 --help

Emulator:
   emu16 --help

Example:
   asm16 -p -o Test.bin Test.asm
   emu16 -V Test.bin

When the program ends the emulator currently stops with:
*** Exception: Invalid non basic opcode: 0
